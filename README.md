# Bookstore CMS - React-Redux App

![main page](src/screenshot.png)

In this milestone, I completed the following tasks:

- Add a new ```presentational``` component: ```CategoryFilter```.

- Create the ```CHANGE_FILTER``` action in ```actions/index.js```.

- Create a ```filter.js``` reducer which modifies ```filter``` in the Redux store.

- Implement the ```CategoryFilter``` component.

- Render the ```CategoryFilter``` component in the ```BooksList``` component.

- Implement the ```handleFilterChange``` method which modifies the filter state in the Redux store.

- Implement a conditional method which decides which books should be shown in the table depending on the ```filter``` value from Redux store.

- Deploy the App on Heroku.
